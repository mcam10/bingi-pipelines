>>> Write me python code to connect to the spotify web playback api to play songs
Here's a Python script that connects to Spotify's Web Playback API and plays songs:
```python
import requests
import json
import time

# Set your Spotify client ID, secret, and redirect URI
client_id = "YOUR_CLIENT_ID"
client_secret = "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET"
redirect_uri = "YOUR_REDIRECT_URI"

# Set the scope and grant type for authentication
scope = "user-library-read playlist-read-private"
grant_type = "client_credentials"

# Get an access token using your client ID and secret
auth_response = requests.post(
    f"https://accounts.spotify.com/api/token",
    headers={"Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"},
    data=f"grant_type={grant_type}&client_id={client_id}&client_secret={client_secret}",
)

access_token = json.loads(auth_response.text)["access_token"]

# Set the Spotify API endpoint and parameters
endpoint = "https://api.spotify.com/v1/playlists"
params = {"offset": 0, "limit": 50}

# Get a list of playlists using your access token
playlists_response = requests.get(endpoint, params=params, headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer
{access_token}"])

# Parse the JSON response and get the first playlist's ID
playlist_id = json.loads(playlists_response.text)["items"][0]["uri"].split(":")[-1]

# Set the endpoint for getting tracks from a playlist
tracks_endpoint = f"https://api.spotify.com/v1/playlists/{playlist_id}/tracks"

# Get the tracks from the playlist using your access token
tracks_response = requests.get(tracks_endpoint, params=params, headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer
{access_token}"})

# Parse the JSON response and get the first track's ID
track_id = json.loads(tracks_response.text)["items"][0]["uri"].split(":")[-1]

# Set the endpoint for playing a track
play_endpoint = "https://api.spotify.com/v1/me/player"

# Set the request body to play the track
play_request_body = {"context_uri": f"spotify:track:{track_id}", "position_ms": 0}

# Play the track using your access token
play_response = requests.put(play_endpoint, json=play_request_body, headers={"Authorization":
f"Bearer {access_token}"})

print("Playing song...")
```
This script does the following:

1. Authenticates with Spotify's API using a client ID and secret.
2. Retrieves a list of playlists for the authenticated user.
3. Gets the ID of the first playlist and uses it to retrieve its tracks.
4. Gets the ID of the first track in the playlist and sets up the request body to play it.
5. Sends the request to start playing the track using the access token.
